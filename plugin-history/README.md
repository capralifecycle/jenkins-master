# Plugin history

This directory holds a list of installed plugins.

It's use is mainly to keep track of manually installed plugins that can
be diffed against an earlier list. Also kept as a reference to initial plugins.

## Updating the list

You need to log in to Jenkins by using a GitHub Personal Access Token that
only needs the read:org scope. For reference see
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+OAuth+Plugin

The script will ask for your username and token.

```bash
./update.sh
```
